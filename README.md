# Wemo Experiments

This is a collection of scripts and projects used to explore the capabilities of
the Wemo products to enhance my life and improve my productivity.

### Getting Started

Get the Wemo device IP for the device you want to control. This can be found in
the Wemo app under the informational view for the device in question. Open
`config.json` and add this IP under `main->ip`.


### Projects

* `wemo_command` - Simple script to manually toggle the Wemo device.
* `proper_charge` - Keeps you Mac's battery between 50% and 90% by cycling the
  device between the two charge barriers.
